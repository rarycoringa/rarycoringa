## Hi, I'm Rary! 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻

#### ABOUT ME

I am a Software Engineer with a strong focus on distributed systems and cloud-native architectures.

My main expertise lies in Python, where I’ve built scalable APIs, workflow engines, and data-intensive services using modern frameworks and libraries.

I'm currently expanding my skills into Java with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, diving into distributed systems, microservice patterns, and resilient service design.
