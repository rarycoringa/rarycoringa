## Hi, I'm Rary! 👋🏽👨🏽‍💻

#### ABOUT ME

I am a Software Engineer with a strong focus on distributed systems and cloud-native architectures. I'm currently working remotely for a UK-based company, collaborating with an international team.

My main expertise is in Python, where I’ve built scalable APIs, workflow engines, and data-intensive services using modern frameworks and libraries.

Lately, I’ve been expanding my skills into Java with Spring Boot and Spring Cloud, diving deeper into microservice patterns, resilient service design, and distributed systems.

I’ve also been learning about gRPC to build efficient, language-agnostic communication between services in distributed environments.
